Drone Image Processing With Plot Finder
========

Plot Finder was designed to automate the extraction of plot level images from orthomosaoics across crop types. There are several different ways to run it depending on your needs. For large scale jobs that are going to be run on a cluster it is recommended to use the [docker image](https://ldelab2.github.io/Plot_Finder/Plot_Finder_Docker_Install.html). Plot Finder can also be run [locally](https://ldelab2.github.io/Plot_Finder/Plot_Finder_Local_Install.html) or installed as a [QGIS Plugin](https://ldelab2.github.io/Plot_Finder/Plot_Finder_QGIS_Install.html).

Documentation for the mathematical underpinning of the algorithm can be found [here](https://ldelab2.github.io/Plot_Finder/Plot_finder_Description.html) and more detailed information can be found in the [reference manual](https://ldelab2.github.io/Plot_Finder/Plot_Finder_Documentation.pdf). Additionally a vignette is available to illustrate the basic workflow for a [Corn](https://ldelab2.github.io/Plot_Finder/Plot_Finder_Corn_Vignette.html) and [Potato](https://ldelab2.github.io/Plot_Finder/Plot_Finder_Potato_Vignette.html) image sets in local, QGIS and cluster environments.
